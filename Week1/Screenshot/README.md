# 1. PHP Introduction

## Screenshot Name

`PHP_Introduction.png`

## Description

This screenshot introduces PHP as a server-side scripting language.

Main concepts covered:

* PHP syntax is influenced by languages such as C and Java.
* PHP is a hybrid language that combines features from different programming languages.
* PHP files use the `.php` extension.
* When a web server receives a PHP file, it sends the file to the PHP processor for execution.

# 2. PHP File Extension and Execution

## Screenshot Name

`PHP_File_Extension.png`

## Description

This screenshot explains how to create and run a PHP file.

Important points:

* PHP files must be saved using the `.php` extension.
* The PHP file should be placed inside the web server root directory.

Examples:

`XAMPP:
C:\xampp\htdocs

WAMP:
C:\wamp\www
`

The PHP application can be accessed through a browser:

`http://localhost/index.php
`

# 3. PHP File Structure

## Screenshot Name

`PHP_File_Structure.png`

## Description

This screenshot explains the structure of a PHP file.

A PHP file can contain three main components:

1. Text content
2. HTML code
3. PHP script

PHP files are different from normal HTML files because they contain PHP instructions processed by the PHP engine.

Important:

* PHP files must have the `.php` suffix.
* PHP files must be stored inside the web server root directory.

Example:

`C:\xampp\htdocs
`

# PHP Tags

## Screenshot Name:

`PHP_Tags.png`

## Description:

This screenshot demonstrates the basic PHP syntax structure.
PHP code is written inside PHP opening and closing tags:

```php
<?php
```

# PHP Generating Output

This section explains how PHP displays output using the `echo` and `print` statements.

# 4. Echo and Print Statements

## Screenshot Name

`PHP_Echo_Print_Code.png`

## Description

This screenshot demonstrates how to generate output in PHP using:

* `echo`
* `print`

Both commands are used to display text in the browser.

### Echo Example

```php
<?php

echo "Welcome to PHP";

echo ("Welcome to PHP");

?>
```

### Print Example

```php
<?php

print "Welcome to PHP";

print ("Welcome to PHP");

?>
```

### Multiple Arguments with Echo

`echo` can display multiple values without parentheses.

Example:

```php
<?php

echo "Abdirahmaan", "Ali";

?>
```

# 5. Echo Statement and Print Statement

## Description

This explains the differences between `echo` and `print`.

### Echo

* Used to output text from the server to the browser.
* Can display one or more parameters.
* Does not return a value.
* Usually faster than print.

Example:

```php
<?php

echo "Hello World";

?>
```

### Print

* Used to display text in the browser.
* Accepts only one parameter.
* Returns a value.

Example:

```php
<?php

print "Hello World";

?>
```

### Important Note

Parentheses are optional for both:

```php
echo "PHP";
print "PHP";
```

or

```php
echo ("PHP");
print ("PHP");
```

# 6. Difference Between Echo and Print

## Screenshot Name

`PHP_Echo_Print_Difference.png`

## Description

This screenshot demonstrates advanced differences between `echo` and `print`.

## Echo

Advantages:

* Accepts multiple parameters. Example:

```php
<?php
echo "Hello World!", " Abdirahmaan ali";
?>
```

Output:

`Hello World! Abdirahmaan Ali Hasan
`

## Print

Limitations:

* Accepts only one parameter. Example:

```php
<?php
print "Hello World!", " PHP";
?>
```

Result:

`Error
`

## Ternary Expression

`print` can be used inside a ternary expression, while `echo` cannot. Example:

```php
<?php
$x = 5;
$y = 10;
$x < $y ? print "x is less than y" : print "x is greater than y";
?>
```
